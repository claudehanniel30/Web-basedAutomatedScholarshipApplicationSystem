## Project Description

The automated scholarship eligibility checker is designed to simplify the process of assessing students' academic performance for scholarship applications. It takes into account their general weighted average (GWA) or cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and compares it against the scholarship criteria set by the institution or organization.

Key features of the system include:

- Automatic grade evaluation: The system automatically checks the students' grade records or transcripts to calculate their GWA or CGPA.
- Scholarship criteria matching: The system compares the calculated GWA or CGPA against the predefined scholarship criteria to determine eligibility.
- Efficient evaluation: By automating the evaluation process, the system saves time and effort for both students and scholarship administrators.
- Accurate and consistent results: The system ensures fair and consistent evaluation by eliminating human error and bias.
- Streamlined scholarship application: Students receive immediate feedback on their eligibility status, allowing them to focus their efforts on scholarships for which they meet the requirements.

## Installation

To set up the automated scholarship eligibility checker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies. This may include specific programming languages, libraries, or frameworks required for the system.

```
# Example command for installing dependencies using Python's pip package manager
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure any necessary settings or environment variables. This might include specifying the scholarship criteria, input file formats, or specific calculations for GWA or CGPA.

## Usage

To use the automated scholarship eligibility checker, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the students' grade records or transcripts in a specific format or required input file.

2. Run the system's main script or executable, providing the necessary input files as arguments.

3. Wait for the system to process the grade records and calculate the GWA or CGPA for each student.

4. The system automatically compares the calculated GWA or CGPA against the predefined scholarship criteria and determines the eligibility of each student.

5. The system generates a report or output indicating which students are eligible for specific scholarships based on their GWA or CGPA.

6. Share the eligibility results with the students or scholarship administrators through a user interface or by exporting the results to a specific format.
